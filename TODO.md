### TODO

- Test the above
- Check if we can change the tooltip font
- Test if spell reflect works
- Test what to happens to EXP message when leveling
- Look into coloring the tooltip according to EavesDrop setting and not based on Blizzard's settings
- Add new spell schools (such as Cosmic) to color options, and start tracking them in EavesDropStats.lua
